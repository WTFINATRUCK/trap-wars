## COPY/VERBIAGE RULES

Use this exact tone:
- Direct, no BS
- Street-level authentic
- Zero corporate jargon
- "Code is law" philosophy
- Built by the culture, for the culture
- Emphasize: permissionless, transparent, on-chain
- No promises, just facts

Example phrases to include:
- "No VC backing. No token unlocks dumping on you."
- "If it's not on-chain, it didn't happen."
- "Your wallet is your resume."
- "Play for the culture, not the hype."

---

## FINAL TOUCHES

- Add subtle grain texture overlay (very subtle)
- Smooth scroll between sections
- Animate numbers counting up when scrolled into view
- Pulsing glow on primary CTA
- Add micro-interactions (button press effects)
- Include "Copy to clipboard" for any shareable links
- Show toast notifications on actions

**Vibe Check**: This should feel like a 90s hacker and a graffiti artist built a Solana game. Dark, authentic, zero fluff. Street credibility over corporate polish.
