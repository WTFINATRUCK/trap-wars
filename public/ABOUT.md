# TRAP WARS

> **Code is Law. Built for the Culture.**

## What Is This?

TRAP WARS is the classic 1990s street economics game reimagined for the blockchain era. Remember Dope Wars? That DOS game where you hustled across NYC, buying low and selling high, dodging cops and making your fortune in 30 days? 

**We brought it back.** But this time, it's powered by **Solana** and **real value**.

No gimmicks. No venture capital. No promises of "the future."  
Just a **game** that's actually **fun** and rewards you with **real tokens**.

---

## The Game

### The Mission
You have **30 days** to make as much money as possible.

### How It Works
1. **Buy products** when prices are low
2. **Travel** between NYC boroughs (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island, Central Park)
3. **Sell** when prices peak
4. **Repeat** and stack your profits
5. **Stake** your earnings to unlock power-ups and protection

### The Catch
Life's not easy on the streets:
- **Police raids** can seize your inventory
- **Muggers** take your cash
- **Random events** shake up the market
- **Limited inventory** means you gotta be strategic

### The Reward
Climb the **leaderboard**. Unlock **ranks**. Build **passive income** through referrals.  
The best players don't just win the game — they **build an empire**.

## Why This Exists

### For the Culture
This isn't a cash grab. This is a love letter to:
- The **dopamine** of finding a deal
- The **risk** of getting caught slipping  
- The **grind** of turning $2,000 into $200,000
- The **nostalgia** of games that respected your time

We didn't need to build this. We **wanted** to.  
Because sometimes, the best projects aren't backed by millions in funding.  
They're built by **people who give a damn**.

### Code is Law
Everything you see is **on-chain**:
- Your wallet = your save file
- Your earnings = your earnings (no central server to "accidentally" lose your progress)
- Your rank = your proof of work

No admins. No rollbacks. No "trust us."  
The smart contract is the referee. And it **never lies**.

---

## Game Mechanics (Without Spoiling the Fun)

### Ranking System
Stake your earnings to unlock ranks. Each rank gives you:
- **Better sell prices** (multipliers)
- **Protection** from bad events (cops can't touch you in your territory)
- **Status** on the leaderboard

Ranks range from 🐀 **Street Rat** to 💎 **Godfather**.  
The higher you climb, the safer you get. But it costs you to stay there.

### Random Events
The streets are **unpredictable**:
- Sometimes you find a **free stash**  
- Sometimes the **cops raid you**  
- Sometimes there's a **fire sale** (50% off)  
- Sometimes **demand spikes** (2x prices)

You can't control luck. But you **can** control how you react to it.

### Referral Program
Build your network, earn passive income.  
Every player you refer = **0.5% of their activity** goes to you (as long as they're staking $100+).

Share your link. Build your crew. **Get paid**.

## What Makes This Different?

### It's Actually Fun
Most crypto games are **work disguised as play**.  
TRAP WARS is a **game disguised as yield farming**.

You're not clicking buttons to "harvest tokens."  
You're making **decisions**, taking **risks**, and feeling the **rush** when you flip that inventory for 3x.

### No Bullshit
- No NFTs you "need" to play  
- No "roadmap" with promises 6 months out  
- No VC unlocks dumping on you  
- No team tokens "for development"

Just a **token** and a **game**.  
If people play, it has value. If they don't, it doesn't.  
That's how it should be.

### Transparent
The entire codebase is open. The contracts are public. The mechanics are clear.

If you want to verify the house edge? **Check the contract.**  
If you want to see how ranks work? **Read the code.**  
If you think something's rigged? **Prove it.**

We're not hiding anything. There's nothing **to** hide.

## The Token: $TRAP

$TRAP is the in-game currency. It's also the **reward** for playing well.

### How You Get It
- Start a new game (you begin with $2,000 in cash, not tokens)
- Play the 30 days, maximize profits
- Your **final score** = your claimable $TRAP
- Stake it to rank up and earn more

### How It Works
- **1 Billion supply** (launched on Pump.fun or similar)
- **House edge**: 5% fee on sells (goes to the vault)
- **Staking rewards**: Earn yield from vault fees
- **Referral earnings**: 0.5% of your refs' activity

### Why It Has Value
Because people **want** to play.  
Because top players **flex** their ranks.  
Because referrers **earn passive income**.

Value isn't promised. It's **earned** through engagement.
